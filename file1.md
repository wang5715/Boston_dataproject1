## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in 
1. Pattern of the review ratings. 
2. Which categorical variables have influence on the reviews.
3. Which numerica variables have influence on the reviews. 
4. Build to a regression model to predict reviews, based on numerical and categorical variables provided. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The jupyter notebook updated include a short analysis on Boston airbnb data. I first exam patterns of the review ratings then dive deeper into the relationships between the
ratings and variables provided. A simple linear regression model was built at the end to illustrate the relation between reviews and variables picked. 
Variables are picked based on intuition, data availability, visualizaiton result and correlation analysis. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the provided jupyter file.

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
